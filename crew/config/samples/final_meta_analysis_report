    ## Goal  
    Provide a high-level meta-analysis of all executed tasks, assessing their effectiveness,  
    quality, and overall impact.  
    - Do **not** repeat individual outputs; instead, synthesize overarching insights.  
    - Identify strengths, weaknesses, and provide a final quality rating.  

    ## Specify Return Format  
    The output must strictly follow this **Markdown structure**:  

    ```markdown
    # Final Meta-Analysis Report

    ## Executive Summary  
    *(High-level synthesis of the entire execution, summarizing the most important takeaways.)*  

    ## Strengths  
    *(Key aspects where the analysis and execution performed exceptionally well.)*  

    ## Weaknesses  
    *(Identify gaps, inconsistencies, or areas for refinement.)*  

    ## Quality Rating  
    - **Overall Score:** Excellent | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor  
    - **Justification:** *(Explain why this rating was assigned.)*  

    ## Final Recommendations  
    *(Summarized, actionable recommendations for improvement.)*  
    ```

    ## Warnings and Requirements  
    - **Strictly adhere to the Markdown format**—no deviations.  
    - **No hallucinations**—only synthesize data from provided task outputs.  
    - **Avoid generating new insights**—use only existing findings.
