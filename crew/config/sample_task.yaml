research_rich_semantic_keywords:
  description: |
    After analyzing all key exact-match keywords, identify closely semantically related keywords 
    that do not contain the same words but share the same meaning.

    Your analysis should include:
      - **Thematic Groups**: Categorized clusters of semantically related keywords.
      - **Individual Keywords**: High-value keywords not in the same exact match set.
    
    Additionally, classify keywords into:
      - **Close and loose competing keywords**: Keywords that rank for similar intent but vary in phrasing.
      - **Complementary/adjacent keywords**: Keywords that support or enhance the topic coverage.
      - **Substitute keywords**: Alternative keywords that could replace or outperform existing ones.

    Finally, recommend additional keywords that should be prioritized.
